TripQ is a decentralized hotel booking platform I developed with my team for the **ETHOS** hackathon, where we successfully advanced to the **final round**. Leveraging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, TripQ eliminates intermediaries, ensuring cost-effective, secure, and transparent transactions for both travelers and hotel owners. The platform integrates The Graph Protocol to streamline data indexing and querying, enabling real-time updates for hotel listings, availability, and bookings. Core features include AI-powered personalized suggestions, Web3 authentication, and cryptocurrency support with TPQ token rewards. With its focus on decentralization, scalability, and trust, TripQ aims to redefine the travel booking experience.
